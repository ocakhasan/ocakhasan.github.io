# About


**Hello there**,

**Welcome to My Blog.**

I graduated :mortar_board: from [Sabanci University](https://www.sabanciuniv.edu/) in 2022 and I am currently working as
Backend Developer :computer: in Turkey. 

I love reading and one day I decided why I do not start a blog so people can read my writings.

I am not a consistent writer but I will try to write more.

There are both Turkish and English posts, and it will be like this in the future as well. 

Please stay tuned,

Bye
