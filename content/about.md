**Hello there**,

**Welcome to Hasan Ocak's Blog.**

I recently graduated :mortar_board: from [Sabanci University](https://www.sabanciuniv.edu/) and I am currently working as
Backend Developer :computer: in Turkey. 

I love reading and one day I decided to start a blog.

I am not a consistent writer but I will try to write more.

Until now I only written in Turkish but I will write in English too.

Please stay tuned,

Bye
