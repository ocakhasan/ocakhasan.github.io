I have never written my long term goals into something and I just want to try it.

Let's see if I will be able to achieve my goals.

**Here is the list**

- [] Read More Books (at least 25)
- [ ] Do more exercise
  - [ ] 10000 pushups
  - [x] start to run regularly
- [x] Write more blog posts
  - [x] at least 1 post per month
  - [x] write non-techincal stuff also (maybe some reviews on books)
- [ ] Go outside more :smile:
- [x] Start to learn investing
- [x] Get a promotion hopefully
  

These are the things that comes to my mind. If anything comes up, I will add it to the list.

Wish me luck!
